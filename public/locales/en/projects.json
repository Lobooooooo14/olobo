It also includes charts displaying the number of clicks, as well as information about the devices and operating systems used to access the links.\n\n## How did it start?\n\nThe project started during a high school *entrepreneurial projects* assignment, where we were allowed to develop software in general.\n\nThe maximum deadline for delivering the project was one month. {{name}} was fully developed within this time, with more focus on weekends when I had more free time. I chose to use **Firebase** as the backend and the **Ionic Framework** for the interface framework, considering the short timeframe, as these tools speed up development and make integration easier. For the charts, I used **MUI charts** to match the design of the Ionic Framework (material design)."

It allows users to chat from anywhere in the world, using Firebase's authentication tools and real-time database.\n\n## About the project\n\nThe project is a reimplementation of [@cookieukw/ArrozChatMaster](https://github.com/cookieukw/ArrozChatMaster/), with the goal of exploring **Firebase** alongside **React**, **Styled Components**, **i18next** and **Vite**.\n\nThis was my first \"big\" project using React, as well as my first experience with Firebase, Framer Motion and i18next. The code isn't the best since I was still learning.\n\nI developed Arroz Chat during high school as part of a group project, where we had to create a product. Although it could have been just an idea, we decided to build something real. We had one week for the development: one member made the logo, another helped with the colors and design, and I programmed everything. I built the whole foundation in 3 days and spent the remaining time refining the project."
